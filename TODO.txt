Find way to incorporate cheers from PRIVMSG's

Incorporate join/leave's to do a viewer list? mainly for chat currency events (NOT POSSIBLE CURRENTLY)

Use the api.twitch.tv to do statistics based things/commands
    - mod/follow/sub list

Currently if a Channel has approx 5000 viewers or more, the server will not send JOIN/PART
    - so realistically the bot should just use the chatters from tmi.twitch.tv to asses user lists for now

Currently a system is in place to catch twitchnotify's in chat in case the USERSTATE for the subscription doesn't show up
    No idea if these are 'real' subs but for now might as well keep the fix until it's hopefully no longer needed
    The concern draws from when the twitchnotify happens but then then the user shares their sub and it appears in chat twice both from the bot and the twitch systems...
    Also if the user doesn't care to share the sub with a custom message, then the bot wouldn't ever send a message in chat

 Need to handle possible disconnects...
    - haven't seen any disconnects as of yet, but having functionality for auto-reconnecting based on ever increasing intervals would be good in case twitch or internet goes down
