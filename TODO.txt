Find way to incorporate cheers from PRIVMSG's

Incorporate join/leave's to do a viewer list? mainly for chat currency events (NOT POSSIBLE CURRENTLY)

Use the api.twitch.tv to do statistics based things/commands
    - mod/follow/sub list

Currently if a Channel has approx 5000 viewers or more, the server will not send JOIN/PART
    - so realistically the bot should just use the chatters from tmi.twitch.tv to asses user lists for now
