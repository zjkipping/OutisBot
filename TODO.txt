Occasionally the server will send more than 1 'response' even when the chat isn't being spammed...
    - Going to have to find a way to check for additional msgs in each 'response' from the servers

Finish up USERNOTICE responses
    - has to do with subbing/resubbing

Find way to incorporate cheers from PRIVMSG's

Incorporate join/leave's to do a viewer list? mainly for chat currency events

Use the api.twitch.tv to do statistics based things/commands
    - mod/follow/sub list
